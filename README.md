# NetRunner-Python
-This is a general purpose neural net library that can generate, evaluate, and optimize neural nets
-pygame is needed for drawing the neural net for easy debugging and numpy is needed for net evaluation 
-One file is included to test the net training
-One file is an obstacle avoidance simulation that can be used to show the net working for a given application
