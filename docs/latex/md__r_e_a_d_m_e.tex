-\/This is a general purpose neural net library that can generate, evaluate, and optimize neural nets ~\newline
 -\/pygame is needed for drawing the neural net for easy debugging and numpy is needed for net evaluation ~\newline
 -\/One file is included to test the net training ~\newline
 -\/One file is an obstacle avoidance simulation that can be used to show the net working for a given application
